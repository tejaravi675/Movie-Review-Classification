# Movie-Review-Classification

1. The task of the project was to classify movie review using machine learning algorithms. The data consists of reviews of a movie in text and its review (sentiment).

2. In this project, three different vectorization techniques are used and for each technique both logistic regression and naive bayes algorithms are applied for 
predictive modelling. Overall, Logistic regression performs better compared to Naive Bayes for all techniques with an average of 85% accuracy.
